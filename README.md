How to open and run the project :)
the project can be accessed by two methods:

1) Accessing 
2) Running it with live server on your own. The project must be downloaded, then extracted into folders. Open the main folder that contains
everything in VS code and right click to open with live server. Hope you enjoy my little project :)
